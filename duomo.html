<h2>1. Il Duomo</h2>
<p>It  was built between 1296 and 1436. The official name of the cathedral is Santa  Maria del Fiore. It is a neo-gothic style fa√ßade. The fresco on the dome&rsquo;s  inside was painted by Giorgio Vasari between 572-1579. It depicts the last  judgement. They have tours that depart daily and the climb to the top up all  463 stairs is all worth it at the top with its breath taking views of the whole  city of Florence.</p>
