<h2>9. Battistero di San Giovanni</h2>
<p>It is said to have been constructed back in the 6thÂ century. What is most famous about the Baptistery is its doors. There was a competition held for who ever could make the best doors for the Baptistery. The doors were completed by Ghiberti which depicted scenes from the bible done in gold. Michelangelo called the doors &ldquo;The Gates of Paradise&rdquo; Today the doors are replaced by replicas, the real doors are guarded in the Museo dell&rsquo;Opera del Duomo.</p>
