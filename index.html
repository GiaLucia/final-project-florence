<h2>Florence, Italy</h2>
<p>This amazing city nestled in the boot of Italy was a great place to study abroad. The memories and experiences that I had living there for 4 months
was one that I could never experience again. The friends that I made throughout my 4 months in Florence have changes my life and who I am. This city might be small but there is so much to do and so much that I did not do while there for 4 months. This site is made in order to encourage students to participate in study abroad programs at Manhattan College not only for Italy but for other countries as well. This trip is worth a lifetime!.</p>
