<h2>6. San Miniato al Monte</h2>
<p>This church is setteled on the top of a hill facing the city  of Florence.  The view from the church is breath taking. There seem to be an endless number  of stairs that you have to climb inorder to reach the top. The Church was built  over the grave of a famous Christian Myrtr Saint Minias. He was of Armenina  decent and some say he was of royality. He was decapitacted. The church started  to be built in 1018 and it took over 200 years to complete it.</p>
